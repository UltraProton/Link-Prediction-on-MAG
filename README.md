# Link-Prediction-on-Microsoft Academic Graph

Link prediction is the problem of predicting links between disconnected vertices of graph. In this project we have extracted list of authors
and their year of publications from Microsoft Academic Graph to construct a bipartite graph. The authors list have only the names who have
published papers in Computer Scince Conferences only to get some interesting patterns.

The final code file is FinalCode3.py.
